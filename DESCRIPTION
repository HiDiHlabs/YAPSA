Description: This package provides functions and routines useful in 
  the analysis of somatic signatures (cf. L. Alexandrov et al., Nature 
  2013). In particular, functions to perform a signature analysis with 
  known signatures (LCD = linear combination decomposition) and a 
  signature analysis on stratified mutational catalogue (SMC = stratify 
  mutational catalogue) are provided.
